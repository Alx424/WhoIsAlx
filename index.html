        <p>Hello! I'm Alex, or Alx for even shorter lol. I'm a high school student going into grade 12 this September and I have a lot of hobbies!</p>
        <p>Here are a few of them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Code, of course!</li>
            <li>Robotics (check out <a src="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5036">FRC Team 5036!</a>)</li>
            <li>Taekwondo (Black belt!ðŸŽ‰)</li>
            <li>Playing music (piano & cello)</li>
            <li>Read</li>
            <li>Crochet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Quite a bit of stuff, to be honest. ðŸ˜…</p>
        <p>I also have a few obsessions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="kirbytext">Kirby!!!</li>
            <li>Spending time with friends!</li>
            <li>Food ðŸ˜‹</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="assets/kirby.gif"/>
        <p>It's been a while since I've written in HTML, it's always a struggle to find time for all my interests. But super worth it of course!</p>
        <p>I really enjoy coding though, when I get in that flow and can't stop. ðŸ˜† 
            I hope that I can continue to use that motivation to make some amazing things!!! The world seems so scary lately, so many issues we need to fix... I hope that I can do my part and help people. 
            Still trying to figure out what I'm going to do after graduating, but I know for sure that I want to be one of those people actively trying (and succeeding) to help others.</p>
        <p>This has been a fun activity! Kinda like a journal entry lol, good for unwinding.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading this far, hopefully this has been at least slightly entertaining lol. Take care, be careful out there.</p>
        <p>-- Alx</p>
